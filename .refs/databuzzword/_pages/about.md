# About

## The Podcast

I started [DataBuzzWord](https://www.spreaker.com/show/jean-louis-queguiners-show) in 2018 following what I considered the biggest news in big data for years : the merger of Cloudera and Hortonworks.

I continued the podcast by interviewing tech people on their speciality always (or mostly) related to data and IT.

After a 18 episodes I had to stop for a while because of personal life events, I will soon get back online with new episode and will try to focus on english content.

In the meantime you can follow me on twitter where I'm really active [@jilijeanlouis](https://twitter.com/JiliJeanlouis).

Don't hesitate to DM me on twitter I usually respond in the day.
